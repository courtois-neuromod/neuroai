    """
    Courtois NeuroMod — *Super Mario Bros* videogaming fMRI dataset.

    Five subjects (sub-01, sub-02, sub-03, sub-05, sub-06) played Super Mario Bros (NES) 
    while undergoing 3T fMRI. Each session included several runs each featuring multiple
    naturalistic gameplays. 

    Sessions were split into two phases (discovery and stable). During the discovery phase,
    participants played each game level in order. Each level had to be cleared at least once
    before the participant could play the next level, until they finished the entire game.

    During the stable phase, levels were mixed pseudo-randomly within and across runs.
    Participants were given up to three attempts ("lives") to successfully clear a given level.

    Stimuli are game frame video files (a.k.a. game replays); gamepad input logs are provided in
    the raw BIDS repository.
